Capstone Project: Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction

Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model capable of predicting hotel booking cancellations using customer and booking data. This helps hoteliers in managing revenue, inventory, and overbooking strategies efficiently. The project follows the supervised learning paradigm using structured tabular data.
Install
This project requires Python 2.7 and the following Python libraries installed:
NumPy
Pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
time
Seaborn
XGBoost

Dataset
The dataset used is a cleaned version of the Hotel Booking Demand Dataset, available from:
UCI Machine Learning Repository
Files used: hotel_bookings-1.csv: Original raw dataset.
hotel_booking_Model_data.csv: Cleaned and preprocessed dataset for model training.

Setup
There is no specific environment or deployment setup required. The notebooks can be run in any Jupyter-compatible environment with the above libraries installed.
